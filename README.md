# ToFran's Smart TTS soundpack:

Smart TTS is a custom sun pack for teamspeak 3. It's a mix between the default female voice and TTS (Text To Speech), in order to create a pleasing Text To Speech sound pack experience. More info in the forum post [forum post].

Note: It was originally designed for Windows 7, on 8+ you may need to tweak Windows text-to-speech settings
